## Data

In the working directory populate the `cities` folder in the following way:

```
> classificationScheme.csv 
> city
  > admin_city.gpkg
  > osm_study_city.osm.pbf
```

Where...

* `classificationScheme.csv` specifies the standard POI classification scheme. More details in [POI Preperation].
* `admin_city.gpkg` delineates area of interest for the study (administrative boundary)
* `osm_study_city.osm.pbf` is an extract of raw OSM data, the basis for the R5R network and POIs.
**To avoid edge effects this area must be at least as large as the study area**.

The study area is defined as the bounding box of the administrative boundary buffered by 4000 m.

## Additional Guidance for Preparing `.pbf` Files

The `.pbf` file format is highly compressed, enabling bulk exports of OSM data. This is well suited
for preparing POIs and is an input for R5R street network network generation. [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/downloads/osm)
is a good provider of this data as they allow for the area of the extract to be set by the user.
However, these `.pbf` files may not include all OSM keys that are relevant for POI preparation.
For this case study, a Europe-wide `.pbf` file was sourced from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe.html) on September 14, 2022. 
A Europe-wide file was downloaded as some study areas overlapped multiple geographic regions. [Osmosis](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis) used for cropping the file into smaller, study-area-specific `.pbf` files. This may not be necessary in all cases, but excessively large `.pbf` files will negatively impact performance, particularly R5R. 

### Osmosis Processing

Osmosis processing was done in two steps:

1. Crop the Europe-wide `.pbf` file to an area **larger** than the study area. In this case: the bounding box of the administrative boundary buffered by 5000 m
2. Crop the `.pbf` file from step 1 to the study area, with `completeWays` and `completeRelations` enabled

As previously mentioned, cropping is applied to improve performance. Enabling `completeWays` and 
`completeRelations` prevents issues during R5R network generation. The two-step procedure is 
implemented to avoid loading the entire Europe-wide `.pbf` file into a temporary folder [(forum post
with more information)](https://dev.openstreetmap.narkive.com/MbbS199a/osm-osmosis-bug-when-using-completeways-option#post7).

## POI Preperation

The `classificationScheme.csv` specifies the classification scheme and must contain the following columns:

* `Active` Should the filter be applied (TRUE/FALSE)
* `Class_A` Finest classification that is to be applied to the POI
* `Filter` Expression passed to `dplyr::case_when()` call responsible for classifying the POIs. The `Filter` column is converted to `R_Filter` by replacing ":" with "\_" as keys with ":" are parsed as "\_" by `osmextract::oe_vectortranslate()`

Columns starting with "Class_" will be retained and made available for accessibility calculations. These can represent higher-level classifications of the POIs.

In the current implementation, each OSM feature represents a single POI. Therefore, **the order of POIs in `classificationScheme.csv` is important!** For example:
OSM data may indicate that a business is both, a cafe and a bakery. By ordering `Cafe` before `Bakery`, precedence is given to the former classification.


```{r include = FALSE}
classificationScheme <-
  read_csv("cities/classificationScheme.csv")%>%
  filter(Active == T)%>% # active classes only
  select(-Comments,-Active)%>%
  mutate(Filter = str_squish(Filter))%>%
  mutate(R_Filter = paste0(str_replace(Filter,":","_"),"~","'",Class_A,"'")) #convert ':' -> '_'  & append Class_A


classificationSchemeFilter<-
  classificationScheme%>%
  .$R_Filter%>%
  paste(collapse = ",")


```

## Classification Scheme Overview

```{r}
classificationScheme %>%
  group_by(Class_C) %>%
  summarise(`POI Classes` = length(unique(Class_B)), POIs = length(unique(Class_A))) %>%
  arrange(desc(POIs)) %>%
  rename(`Moreno Classification (Class_C)` = "Class_C")
```
### Full Classification Scheme
```{r}
classificationScheme
```

### Keys of Interest (KOI)

The following keys are utilized by the classification scheme:

```{r}
# regex for extracting all OSM keys in classificationScheme
# 
koiExtractRegex <- paste0("(?<=(^|\\(|!|\\||\\&))[a-z_:]+(?=(==)|(%in%)|<|>|(<=)|(>=)|(!=)", # key defined as any number number of (lower case!) a-z characters and ':' which occur after the start of a string, '(', '!','|', or '&' and before the operators: '==', '%in%', '<', '>','<=',''>=','!='
                          "|(>=)|(!=))|(?<=(\\())[a-z_:]+(?=\\))") # key defined as any number number of (lower case!) a-z characters and ':' nested between '(' and ')'

temp_koi_extract<-
classificationScheme%>%
  mutate(Filter_KOI_Extract_Debug = Filter%>%
           str_replace_all('[\'\"](.*?)[\'\"]',"___")%>% # remove everything within quotations (& replace w placeholder for easy viewing)
           str_replace_all(" ",""), #remove whitespace,
         KOI = Filter_KOI_Extract_Debug%>%str_extract_all(koiExtractRegex),
         Filter_KOI_Extract_Debug = Filter_KOI_Extract_Debug%>%str_replace_all(koiExtractRegex,"VAR") # for easy viewing / verification
           
           ) 

koi<-c(temp_koi_extract$KOI%>%unlist()%>%unique(),additional_koi)%>%unique()
       
koi_alt <- koi%>%str_replace_all(":","_") # for working with processed data (laundered keys)!


koi
  
```

**Debuging:**

The automatic recognition of KOI using regex (above code chunk) is sensitive and may fail with unexpected filter formatting. The following table can be used to verify that KOI are being extracted correctly from classification scheme. Note that the regex implementation is for convienence, and can be replaced with a simple character vector `koi <- c('amenity','shop,...)` 

```{r}
temp_koi_extract%>%rowwise()%>%mutate(KOI = paste(unique(KOI),collapse = ","))%>%ungroup()
```

### Refine Classification of Supermarkets

Attempt to distinguish between smaller, local stores and major, chain supermarkets. While the latter 
may be functionally the same, the data quality in OSM makes this difficult to determine. Most of the 
time, such stores tend to be more specialized and may not be well suited to satisfying day-to-day shopping needs. 
The implemented approach attempts to identify major chains by searching the `name`, `brand`, and `operator` keys of features
tagged as supermarkets (excluding ethnic supermarkets). If one of the aggregated values occurs at least
5 times, it is added to a list of "major supermarket names". If a **Supermarket** has a `name`, `brand`, or `operator`
with a partial or full match to the list of "major supermarket names", it retains its classification.
Otherwise, the feature is reclassified as a **Food Store** (`Class_A = 'Food Store', Class_B = 'Other Food Stores'`)



**MAJOR SUPERMARKET NAMES**

## Assign POI Access Points to Grid Cells

### Access Points

Access points are defined for all POIs. Processing is dependent on the geometry of the POI:
 
**ENTRANCES NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED**
 
* `POINT`: feature geometry already represents its single access point
* `POLYGON`: centroid and, if the area is equal or greater than `r poi_access_point_area_threshold/10000` ha, the intersections of the boundary and the street network (representing "entrances")
* `MULTIPOLYGON`: the intersections of the boundary and the street network (representing "entrances") 


All POI access points are assigned to the nearest cell. Duplicate access points are removed to avoid redundancy.

## Travel Time Matrix

A travel time matrix with from cells within the administrative area to cells within the study area (which have at least 1 POI access point) is determined. The following parameters are used:

* max walking time: `r r5r_max_walk_time`
* walk speed: `r r5r_walk_speed` km/hr

## POIs associated with Travel Time Matrix

POI **access points** are joined to the travel time matrix. For each origin, POI pair: the **nearest** access point is retained.
The resulting data frame enables accessibility metric calculations. This data frame is written to `results/grid_ttm_access.csv` and has the following columns:

* `from_id`: origin grid cell
* `to_id`: destination grid cell
* `Class_C`
* `Class_B`
* `travel_time_p50`: travel time from origin to destination grid cell
* `n`: number of POIs reached at `travel_time_p50`
* `cum_pois`: cumulative number of POIs reached at `travel_time_p50`

Required input is a geopackage with "population" in the name. The geopackage must have polygons of city
districts with the associated population. The population must be in a field named "population"

Population data will not be disaggregated for cities without the required input data.

## Accessibility Metric Calculation

**(Play with `results/grid_ttm_access.csv` to get desired result)**

`accessibility_min_tt` provides the minimum travel time to reach each `Class_C` POI (20 min max). Additionally:
* An average, minimum travel time is computed (`mean_min_tt`)
* # of Moreno classes with at least 1 POI accessible within 20 minutes (`n`)
